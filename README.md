# About

This extension was developed largely in response to the horrible quality of Ada syntax highlighters, whether for VS Code or otherwise. It's all too apparent they were created by people who barely, if at all, work with the language.

# Features

* Highlighting for **pragmas** and **aspects**.
* Highlighting for **types**, something often missed, and as I understand it only also seen in GPS.
* Highlighting for `.adc` files (`.gpr` is on the way), not just `.adb` and `.ads`
